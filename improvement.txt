● Summary

  The SEPA data downloading logic is well-structured with async operations, retry mechanisms, and proper error handling. The scraper:

  1. Connects to the government data portal using httpx with retry logic
  2. Parses HTML to find package containers matching today's date
  3. Extracts download links from matching packages with "DESCARGAR" buttons
  4. Downloads files with streaming and progress bars to data/ directory
  5. Handles multiple formats (zip/csv) with date-based naming

  Key Improvements

  1. Configuration Management

  - Move hardcoded URL and selectors to config file
  - Add environment variables for different deployment scenarios

  2. Enhanced Error Handling

  - Add specific exceptions for different failure scenarios
  - Implement circuit breaker pattern for repeated failures
  - Add file integrity validation (checksums)

  3. Data Management

  - Check if file already exists before downloading
  - Add support for historical date ranges
  - Implement automatic zip extraction
  - Add file deduplication logic

  4. Robustness

  - Add user-agent rotation and request headers
  - Implement rate limiting to avoid being blocked
  - Add content validation before saving files

  5. Observability

  - Add metrics collection (download success/failure rates)
  - Implement structured logging with correlation IDs
  - Add health checks and monitoring endpoints

  6. Storage & Deployment

  - Add cloud storage integration (S3/Azure Blob)
  - Implement configurable storage backends
  - Add support for different file retention policies
